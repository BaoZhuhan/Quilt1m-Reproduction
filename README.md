# Quilt1m-Reproduction

## Reproduction of Quilt1m

I have successfully reproduced the Quilt1m project by following the [original Repo](https://github.com/wisdomikezogwo/quilt1m) and correcting some code errors. The demo image-text pair data generated is located at:  

- Images (frames): [data/quilt/frames](./data/quilt/frames)  
- Image-text pairs: [/data/quilt/quilt_data_df.csv](./data/quilt/quilt_data_df.csv)
